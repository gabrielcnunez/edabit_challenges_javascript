// RegEx Exercise 1: Find the Time
// The time has a format: hours:minutes. Both hours and minutes have two digits, like 09:00.

// Make a regexp to find time in the string: Breakfast at 09:00 in the room 123:456. In this task thereâ€™s no need to check time correctness yet, so 25:99 can also be a valid result. The regexp should not match 123:456.

// Notes
// The solution is in the Resources tab.

function regExp(str) {
  return str.match(/\b\d\d:\d\d\b/)
}

module.exports = regExp;
