// Return the Time Saved by Speeding
// One cause for speeding is the desire to shorten the time spent traveling. 
// In long distance trips, speeding does save an appreciable amount of time. 
// However, the same cannot be said about short distance trips.

// Create a function that calculates the amount of time saved were you 
// traveling with an average speed that is above the speed-limit as compared 
// to traveling with an average speed exactly at the speed-limit.

// Examples
// // The parameter's format is as follows:
// // (speed limit, avg speed, distance traveled at avg speed)

// timeSaved(80, 90, 40) ➞ 3.3

// timeSaved(80, 90, 4000) ➞ 333.3

// timeSaved(80, 100, 40 ) ➞ 6.0

// timeSaved(80, 100, 10) ➞ 1.5

// Notes
// Speed = distance/time
// The time returned should be in minutes, not hours.
// Round the answer to one decimal place.
// The speed limit and average speed are both given in mi/hr

function timeSaved(lim, avg, dist) {
