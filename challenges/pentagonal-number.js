// Pentagonal Number
// Write a function that takes a positive integer num and calculates how 
// many dots exist in a pentagonal shape around the center dot on the Nth iteration.

// In the image below you can see the first iteration is only a single dot. 
// On the second, there are 6 dots. On the third, there are 16 dots, and on the fourth there are 31 dots.


// Return the number of dots that exist in the whole pentagon on the Nth iteration.

// Examples
// pentagonal(1) ➞ 1

// pentagonal(2) ➞ 6

// pentagonal(3) ➞ 16

// pentagonal(8) ➞ 141

// Notes
// N/A
