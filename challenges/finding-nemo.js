// Finding Nemo
// You're given a string of words. You need to find the word "Nemo", and return a string 
// like this: "I found Nemo at [the order of the word you find Nemo]!".

// If you can't find Nemo, return "I can't find Nemo :(".

// Examples
// findNemo("I am finding Nemo !") ➞ "I found Nemo at 4!"

// findNemo("Nemo is me") ➞ "I found Nemo at 1!"

// findNemo("I Nemo am") ➞ "I found Nemo at 2!"

// Notes
// ! , ? . are always separated from the last word.
// Nemo will always look like Nemo, and not NeMo or other capital variations.
// Nemo's, or anything that says Nemo with something behind it, doesn't count as Finding Nemo.
// If there are multiple Nemo's in the sentence, only return the first one.
