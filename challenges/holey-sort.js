// Holey Sort
// What do the numbers 4, 6, 8, 9 and 0 have in common? They 
// all have holes in them! Notice how the number 8 contains not one, but two holes.

// Given an array of numbers, sort the array in accordance to 
// how many holes occur in the number. It should be sorted in ascending order.

// Examples
// holeySort([44, 4, 444, 4444]) ➞ [4, 44, 444, 4444]

// holeySort([100, 888, 1660, 11]) ➞ [11, 100, 1660, 888]

// holeySort([8, 121, 41, 66]) ➞ [121, 41, 8, 66]

// Notes
// If two numbers have the same number of holes in them, 
// sort them by the order they first appeared in.
// Despite the number 0 appearing to have two holes in certain 
// fonts, it will only have one hole for the purposes of this challenge.
