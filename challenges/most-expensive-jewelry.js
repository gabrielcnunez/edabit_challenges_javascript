// Return the Most Expensive Piece of Jewellery
// You go to a jewelry shop and try to find the most expensive piece of jewelry. 
// You write down the name of each piece of jewelry and its price.

// Create a function that gets the name of the piece of jewelry with the highest 
// price and returns "The most expensive one is the {name of jewelry piece}".

// Examples
// mostExpensive ({
//   "Diamond Earrings": 980,
//   "Gold Watch": 250,
//   "Pearl Necklace": 4650
// }) ➞  "The most expensive one is the Pearl Necklace"

// mostExpensive({
//   "Silver Bracelet": 280,
//   "Gemstone Earrings": 180,
//   "Diamond Ring": 3500
// }) ➞ "The most expensive one is the Diamond Ring"

// Notes
// There will always be at least one item in the object.
// There will always be only one highest priced item (i.e. there will not be two items with the joint highest value).
