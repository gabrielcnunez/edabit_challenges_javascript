// Older Than Me
// Create a method in the Person class which returns how another person's 
// age compares. Given the instances p1, p2 and p3, which will be initialized 
// with the attributes name and age, return a sentence in the following format:

// {other person name} is {older than / younger than / the same age as} me.

// Examples
// p1 = Person("Samuel", 24)
// p2 = Person("Joel", 36)
// p3 = Person("Lily", 24)
// p1.compareAge(p2) ➞ "Joel is older than me."

// p2.compareAge(p1) ➞ "Samuel is younger than me."

// p1.compareAge(p3) ➞ "Lily is the same age as me."
